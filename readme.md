# Tetris

---

- Game of Tetris I created around 2017 while learning about JavaScript (at the time i thought so)
- Code was written without proper knowledge of JS paradigm and I didn't know if I was writing it the way it was supposed to be written (the final result clearly reflects what I am saying ;)), but the game itself turned out to be somewhat enjoyable and I was happy about it.
- The most difficult problem i had to face was rotation of the falling shape, but I managed to find the solution on my own and the result can be seen in `shape` method, called `rotate` (`./src/Tetris_variklis.js` line 154).
- To run the game, clone this repository and open `Tetris_P5JS.html` file using preferred browser.
- The game itself is not finished, it lacks of a score counter and an option to restart the game after loss. I did not implement such functionality, because it did not seem like a challenge after completion of physics and rules.
- To be honest, this project did not really help me learn JS, as it lacked of a DOM manipulation (initial purpose of JS), but it was fun little project to work with. I chose JS because of p5.js library, which provided tools for simple graphics and let me focus on key principles of the game.
