# Tetris

---

- Game of Tetris I implemented around 2017 while learning JavaScript.
- Code was written without proper knowledge of JS, but the game mechanics turned out to be somewhat enjoyable and I was happy with it.
- Major problem was the rotation of the falling shape, but I managed to find the solution on my own. The result can be seen in the `shape` method, called `rotate` (`./src/Tetris_variklis.js` line 154).

## Install 
- To run the game, clone this repo and open `Tetris_P5JS.html` file with a preferred browser.
- The game is not finished, it lacks a score counter and an option to restart the game after a loss.
